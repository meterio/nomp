#### Meter Node Open Mining Portal

This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining pool written
entirely in Node.js. It contains a stratum poolserver; reward/payment/share processor; and a (_not yet completed_)
responsive user-friendly front-end website featuring mining instructions, in-depth live statistics, and an admin center.

#### Production Usage Notice

This is beta software. All of the following are things that can change and break an existing NOMP setup: functionality of any feature, structure of configuration files and structure of redis data. If you use this software in production then _DO NOT_ pull new code straight into production usage because it can and often will break your setup and require you to tweak things like config files or redis data.

#### Paid Solution

Usage of this software requires abilities with sysadmin, database admin, coin daemons, and sometimes a bit of programming. Running a production pool can literally be more work than a full-time job.

Payment should be disabled in meter project. The beneficiary address is meter Pos address, not recognized in Pow mining.

**Coin switching & auto-exchanging for payouts in BTC/LTC** to miners is a feature that very likely will not be included in this project.

### Features

- For the pool server it uses the highly efficient [node-stratum-pool](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool) module which
  supports vardiff, POW & POS, transaction messages, anti-DDoS, IP banning, [several hashing algorithms](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#hashing-algorithms-supported).

- The portal has an [MPOS](//github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) compatibility mode so that the it can
  function as a drop-in-replacement for [python-stratum-mining](//github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining). This
  mode can be enabled in the configuration and will insert shares into a MySQL database in the format which MPOS expects.
  For a direct tutorial see the wiki page [Setting up NOMP for MPOS usage](//github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal/wiki/Setting-up-NOMP-for-MPOS-usage).

- Multi-pool ability - this software was built from the ground up to run with multiple coins simultaneously (which can
  have different properties and hashing algorithms). It can be used to create a pool for a single coin or for multiple
  coins at once. The pools use clustering to load balance across multiple CPU cores.

- For reward/payment processing, shares are inserted into Redis (a fast NoSQL key/value store). The PROP (proportional)
  reward system is used with [Redis Transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions) for secure and super speedy payouts.
  There is zero risk to the pool operator. Shares from rounds resulting in orphaned blocks will be merged into share in the
  current round so that each and every share will be rewarded

- This portal does not have user accounts/logins/registrations. Instead, miners simply use their coin address for stratum
  authentication. A minimalistic HTML5 front-end connects to the portals statistics API to display stats from from each
  pool such as connected miners, network/pool difficulty/hash rate, etc.

- Coin-switching ports using coin-networks and crypto-exchange APIs to detect profitability. Miner's connect to these ports
  with their public key which NOMP uses to derive an address for any coin needed to be paid out.

#### Attack Mitigation

- Detects and thwarts socket flooding (garbage data sent over socket in order to consume system resources).
- Detects and thwarts zombie miners (botnet infected computers connecting to your server to use up sockets but not sending any shares).
- Detects and thwarts invalid share attacks:
  - NOMP is not vulnerable to the low difficulty share exploits happening to other pool servers. Other pool server
    software has hardcoded guesstimated max difficulties for new hashing algorithms while NOMP dynamically generates the
    max difficulty for each algorithm based on values founds in coin source code.
  - IP banning feature which on a configurable threshold will ban an IP for a configurable amount of time if the miner
    submits over a configurable threshold of invalid shares.
- NOMP is written in Node.js which uses a single thread (async) to handle connections rather than the overhead of one
  thread per connection, and clustering is also implemented so all CPU cores are taken advantage of.

#### Security

NOMP has some implicit security advantages for pool operators and miners:

- Without a registration/login system, non-security-oriented miners reusing passwords across pools is no longer a concern.
- Automated payouts by default and pool profits are sent to another address so pool wallets aren't plump with coins -
  giving hackers little reward and keeping your pool from being a target.
- Miners can notice lack of automated payments as a possible early warning sign that an operator is about to run off with their coins.

#### Planned Features

- NOMP API - Used by the website to display stats and information about the pool(s) on the portal's front-end website,
  and by the NOMP Desktop app to retrieve a list of available coins (and version-bytes for local wallet/address generation).

- To reduce variance for pools just starting out which have little to no hashing power a feature is planned which will
  allow your own pool to connect upstream to a larger pool server. It will request work from the larger pool then
  redistribute the work to our own connected miners.

_Having problems getting the portal running due to some module dependency error?_ It's probably because you
didn't follow the instructions in this README. Please **read the usage instructions** including [requirements](#requirements) and [downloading/installing](#1-downloading--installing). If you've followed the instructions completely and are still having problems then open an issue here on github or join our #nomp IRC channel and explain your problem :).

If your pool uses NOMP let us know and we will list your website here.

# Usage

#### Requirements

- Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

##### Seriously

Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.

[**Redis security warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): be sure firewall access to redis - an easy way is to
include `bind 127.0.0.1` in your `redis.conf` file. Also it's a good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

#### 0) Setting up meter daemon

Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:

```
daemon=1
rpcuser=testuser
rpcpassword=testpass
rpcport=8332
```

#### 1) Downloading & Installing

Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meterio/meter-nomp.gits
cd nomp
npm update
```

#### 2) Configuration

##### Portal config

Inside the `config_example.json` file, ensure the default configuration will work for your environment, then copy the file to `config.json`.

##### Coin config

Inside the `coins` directory, ensure a json file exists for your coin. If it does not you will have to create it.
Here is an example of the required fields:

```javascript
{
    "name": "Meter",
    "symbol": "MTR",
    "algorithm": "sha256",

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. It is found in the daemon
       source code as the pchMessageStart variable.
       For example, litecoin mainnet magic: http://git.io/Bi8YFw
       And for litecoin testnet magic: http://git.io/NXBYJA */

    //"txMessages": false, //options - defaults to false

    //"mposDiffMultiplier": 256, //options - only for x11 coins in mpos mode
}
```

For additional documentation how to configure coins and their different algorithms
see [these instructions](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage).

##### Pool config

Take a look at the example json file inside the `pool_configs` directory. Rename it to `yourcoin.json` and change the
example fields to fit your setup.

You can create as many of these pool config files as you want (such as one pool per coin you which to operate).
If you are creating multiple pools, ensure that they have unique stratum ports.

For more information on these configuration options see the [pool module documentation](https://github.com/meterio/meter-stratum-pool)

#### 3) Start the portal

```bash
node init.js
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:

- Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
  in case the master process crashes.
- Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
  for exploring your redis database.
- Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log
  output from NOMP.
- Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your NOMP instance and server performance.

#### Upgrading NOMP

When updating NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the `meter-stratum-pool` and any config files that may have been changed.

- Inside your NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest NOMP code.
- Remove the dependenices by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
- Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
- Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/meter.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.
